Platform Jumper

** Build & Execution Instructions **
To use this application, first type 'make' and then './run'.  The application will require
libSDL, libSDL_ttf, and libSDL_image to build.

** Goal **
Control the player with the arrow keys.  You can jump with space bar.  Explore around the world,
watching out for the monsters (even though they won't hurt you yet...)

** Extra Features **
Maps can be loaded from files (examples in maps/ subdirectory).  The map to load can be
specified as a parameter to the executable.  NOTE: the maps/ directory is assumed and should
not be specified as part of the parameter.
	Ex: ./run level2.map

** Known Flaws **
- Occasionally the game will crash as it is starting up.  The cause has been traced to
  a particular function but has not yet been resolved.
- Occasionally the game will crash as it is exiting.  The causes appears to be related
  to a pointer that is being freed multiple times, but has not yet been resolved.
