Rising Tide

** Build & Execution Instructions **
To use this application, first type 'make' and then './run'.  The application will require
libSDL, libSDL_ttf, libSDL_mixer and libSDL_image to build.  A zip of the source will also
be assembled and stored in build/ and web/download/.

** Goal **
Control the player with the arrow keys.  You can jump with the up key and shoot with 
the space bar.  Explore around the world, watching out for the monsters.  After about
ten seconds the camera will start to scroll upward and player will have to jump from 
platform to platform to avoid the impending flood

** Extra Features **
Maps can be loaded from files (examples in maps/ subdirectory).  The map to load can be
specified as a parameter to the executable.  NOTE: the maps/ directory is assumed and should
not be specified as part of the parameter.
	Ex: ./run level2.map
	
Memory manager classes have been implemented to optimize the loading of resources (currently
sound and images).
