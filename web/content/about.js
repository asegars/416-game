var c_about = "<h2>The History of the Game</h2><p>Rising Tide came into being during the fall of 2009 as a part of a game design class at Clemson University. \
Two undergraduate students, Tim Curtis and Luke Segars, came up with the idea and developed it as the semester progressed.</p> \

<p>I've always been a gamer, since the age of 4.  Though, through all of the \
years I've spent playing games, sometimes just playing them wasn't enough. \
 I wanted to know why things worked the way they did in games, how the \
game was interacting with the person playing it, and what specific things \
could the player learn from the game.  Plainly put, I enjoyed not only the \
challenge, but the ideas behind the challenge as well.</p> \

<p>The more experience I have with computer science, the more I regard \
it as an art as well as a science.  In many ways, creating computer games \
is a perfect blend of both, requiring both free-flowing creativity and \
deep technical understanding.  It also provides a practical application for \
computing topics that can be appreciated by both technical and nontechnical people. \
Creating games appeals to me not only as a personal challenge but as a way of making \
computer science interesting to people who don't study it every day. </p> \
