Milestone 3

This milestone was designed to experiment with scrolling backgrounds.  I took advantage of
the opportunity and tested player movement along with more advanced camera behavior at 
the same time as extensions to the base assignment.

Usage
 - To build, type make.  SDL and SDL_image development libraries are required.

Directions
 - Use the arrow keys to move the dark blue flying saucer.
 - Hit the space bar to toggle between which unit the camera is "focusing" on.

Sprite Creation
 - All of my sprites were hand-drawn in GIMP 2.6.6.  The original GIMP files in XCF format
   were also included in the images/ folder of the submission.

Extensions
 - The camera was adjusted to center on the camera "focus" (initially the player) whenever
    possible.  If the focused piece is in a corner or against an edge, the viewport will
    bump up against the wall.
 - X & Y direction movement for player's saucer.  The camera will adjust as necessary to
    accomodate the player's movements.
 - The camera's focus can be switched on demand while the game is being played.  An extra
    "enemy" was added to the game that can be tracked by the camera alternatively to the
    player's piece.  To toggle between the unit being tracked, press <SPACE>.
